**IPL Data Analysis Project** using Data Engineering, with **Databricks**, **AWS S3**, **AWS Redshift**, and **Pandas**: <br>

This IPL Data Analysis project demonstrates the integration of cloud technologies (AWS S3, AWS Redshift) with Databricks to build an efficient data pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and storing large-scale cricket statistics. It allows for in-depth analysis and insights into IPL performance across regions and player roles, making it a powerful tool for teams, analysts, and enthusiasts.

### 1. **Data Ingestion (AWS S3):**
   - IPL data (player stats, match results, team performance) is ingested into **AWS S3** from various sources.
   - Data is stored in formats like CSV, JSON, or Parquet.

### 2. **Data Transformation (Databricks & Pandas):**
   - **Databricks** is used for distributed data processing with **PySpark** for large datasets.
   - **Pandas** is used for smaller datasets or interactive, in-memory transformations.
     - Cleaning, enriching, and aggregating data.
     - Example: Calculating batting averages or rolling averages for players.
   
### 3. **Data Storage (AWS Redshift):**
   - Transformed data is stored in **AWS Redshift** for scalable querying and analysis.
   - Data is structured into tables for easy reporting on player stats, team performance, and match outcomes.
   
### 4. **Data Analysis & Reporting:**
   - **Pandas** allows for quick exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
   - Visualizations (e.g., bar charts) are created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for insights on team performance, regions, or player stats.
   
### 5. **Security & Monitoring:**
   - **AWS IAM** and **Databricks** security features control access to data in S3, Databricks, and Redshift.
   - **CloudTrail** and **Audit Logs** monitor and log activities for compliance and security.

### **Conclusion:**
   - The project leverages **AWS S3** for data storage, **Databricks** for transformation, and **AWS Redshift** for efficient querying.
   - **Pandas** adds flexibility for smaller datasets and rapid, interactive analysis.
   - The pipeline ensures secure, scalable, and insightful analysis of IPL data for performance metrics, player statistics, and team trends.
