**IPL Data Analysis Project** using Data Engineering, with **Databricks**, **AWS S3**, **AWS Redshift**, and **Pandas**: <br>

This IPL Data Analysis project demonstrates the integration of cloud technologies (AWS S3, AWS Redshift) with Databricks to build an efficient data pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and storing large-scale cricket statistics. It allows for in-depth analysis and insights into IPL performance across regions and player roles, making it a powerful tool for teams, analysts, and enthusiasts.

 ● Build a robust data pipeline for IPL analytics using Python, Pandas, and AWS services, enabling structured data
        intake and preprocessing for foundational steps for scalable AI model integration. <br>
● Used Pandas for data Transformation and NumPy for efficient numerical computations, enabling smooth pipeline. <br>
● Stored Transformed datasets in AWS S3 using reusable logic to ensure consistent, high-quality data that’s ready for downstream use in analytics, machine learning, and Redshift based reporting. <br>
      ●  Developed a modular pipeline that supports future integration with LLM-based models for generating automated   
          performance summaries or insights, aligning with Debricked’s direction towards AI-powered solutions.


### **Conclusion:**
   - The project leverages **AWS S3** for data storage, **Databricks** for transformation, and **AWS Redshift** for efficient querying.
   - **Pandas** adds flexibility for smaller datasets and rapid, interactive analysis.
   - The pipeline ensures secure, scalable, and insightful analysis of IPL data for performance metrics, player statistics, and team trends.
